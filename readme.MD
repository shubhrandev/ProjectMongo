MY PROJECT FOR MONGODB IS
EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE IN MANUFACTURING

Equipment maintenance in manufacturing is similar to providing routine inspections and care for the tools and machinery used in the production process. Manufacturers service their machinery on a regular basis, much like you take your car in for routine maintenance to keep it in good working order.

Imagine a factory where the machinery is always running, producing goods all day long. The entire production line may come to a stop if one of these machines suddenly breaks down. In addition to causing orders to be delayed, this also costs the business a lot of money in lost productivity and possible repairs.Manufacturers use various maintenance techniques to avoid such situations. Preventive maintenance is one approach, which is akin to adhering to a schedule for examining and maintaining machinery before they have an opportunity to malfunction. It is comparable to scheduling routine examinations at the dentist to identify any issues early on.

Another approach is predictive maintenance, which is more like using clues and data from the machines themselves to predict when they might need attention. It's like how your phone tells you when it's running low on battery, but for machines.Then there's corrective maintenance, which is like fixing things when they do go wrong, a bit like calling a plumber when your sink is leaking.By taking care of their equipment, manufacturers can avoid unexpected breakdowns, keep production running smoothly, and ultimately save money by avoiding costly repairs and downtime.
